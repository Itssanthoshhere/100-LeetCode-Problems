# Additional Notes 📝

- **Alternate Placement 🔄:**  
  By using two pointers (one for positive numbers starting at index 0 and one for negative numbers starting at index 1), the solution arranges elements in an alternating pattern.

- **Order Preservation 📋:**  
  The relative order of positive and negative numbers is maintained as they are placed in the output array in the same order they appear in the input.

- **In-Place Reordering Concept 🚀:**  
  Although this solution uses extra space for the output array, the technique of alternating indices can be adapted for in-place reordering in similar scenarios.

- **Time Complexity ⏱️:**  
  The algorithm traverses the array once, resulting in O(n) time complexity.

Keep challenging yourself and happy coding! 😊
