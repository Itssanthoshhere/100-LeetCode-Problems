# Additional Notes 📝

- **In-Place Modification:**  
  The solution works by modifying the original array to place unique elements in the first `k` positions. 🔄

- **Two-Pointer Technique:**  
  Using two pointers (`i` and `j`) helps efficiently traverse the array and update it without extra space.

- **Time Complexity:**  
  The algorithm runs in O(n) time, making it efficient for large inputs. ⏱️

- **Edge Case:**  
  If the array is empty, the function returns 0.

This problem is a great exercise in optimizing space by modifying the array in-place while maintaining order. Enjoy coding! 😊
