# Problem 14 - Sort Colors

**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Platform:** LeetCode

## Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them **in-place** so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

- **Representation:**  
  - 0: Red  
  - 1: White  
  - 2: Blue

**Note:** You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

## Examples

**Example 1:**  
```
Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
```

**Example 2:**  
```
Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]
```
