# Additional Notes 📝

- **Dutch National Flag Algorithm 🎨:**  
  The solution leverages a three-pointer approach to partition the array into three segments:  
  - **Low pointer (red):** Tracks the boundary for 0s.  
  - **Mid pointer (white):** Traverses the array.  
  - **High pointer (blue):** Tracks the boundary for 2s.

- **In-Place Sorting 🚀:**  
  No extra space is used since sorting is done within the input array.

- **Time Complexity ⏱️:**  
  The algorithm runs in O(n) time, making it efficient for large inputs.

- **Use Cases 🔍:**  
  A great exercise to understand partitioning algorithms and in-place modifications without relying on library sort functions.

Happy coding and keep challenging yourself! 😊
