# Additional Notes

- **Negative Numbers:** Negative integers return `false` because the minus sign is not mirrored.
- **Overflow Check:** A `long` is used for `revNum` to safely handle reversal without overflow.
- **Efficiency:** The solution runs in O(n) time where n is the number of digits in the number.
