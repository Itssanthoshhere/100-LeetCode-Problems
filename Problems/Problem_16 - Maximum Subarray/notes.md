# Additional Notes 📝

- **Kadane’s Algorithm 🚀:**  
  This solution implements Kadane’s algorithm, which efficiently computes the maximum subarray sum in O(n) time by iteratively accumulating a running sum and resetting it when it becomes negative.

- **Why Reset the Sum? 🔄**  
  If the running sum becomes negative, it can't contribute to a larger sum for subsequent subarrays, so we reset it to 0.

- **Efficiency ⏱️:**  
  The algorithm processes the array in a single pass (O(n) time) and uses only constant extra space (O(1)).

- **Real-World Relevance 💡:**  
  Understanding this technique is valuable for optimizing performance in competitive programming and technical interviews.

Happy coding and keep challenging yourself! 😊
