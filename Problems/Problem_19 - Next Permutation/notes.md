# Additional Notes 📝

- **Algorithm Insight 🔍:**  
  This solution is based on finding the first element (from right) that is smaller than its successor. This index determines where the current permutation can be increased.

- **In-Place Operation 🚀:**  
  The algorithm rearranges the elements directly in the array, ensuring constant space usage (O(1)).

- **Time Complexity ⏱️:**  
  The solution performs in O(n) time, making it efficient for large inputs.

- **Real-World Applications 💡:**  
  Understanding next permutation is valuable for solving combinatorial problems and is a common interview topic.

Keep exploring and happy coding! 😊
