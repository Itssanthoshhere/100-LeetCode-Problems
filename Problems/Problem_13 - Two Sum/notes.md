# Additional Notes 📝

- **Map for Lookup 🗺️:**  
  The solution uses a map to store each number's index. This allows us to check in constant time whether the complement (i.e., `target - num`) has already been seen.

- **Time Complexity ⏱️:**  
  The approach runs in O(n) time, where n is the number of elements in the array.

- **Space Complexity 🚀:**  
  Extra space is O(n) due to the map, but it meets the problem constraints.

- **Optimal Approach 💡:**  
  Using a map ensures that we find the solution in one pass through the array, which is both efficient and elegant.

Happy coding and keep challenging yourself! 😊
