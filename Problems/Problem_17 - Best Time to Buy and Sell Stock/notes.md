# Additional Notes 📝

- **Single Pass Efficiency 🚀:**  
  The solution processes the array in one pass (O(n) time complexity) by keeping track of the minimum price and computing the potential profit on the fly.

- **In-Place Computation 💡:**  
  No extra space is needed (O(1) space complexity), which makes this approach optimal.

- **Real-World Relevance 🔍:**  
  This algorithm is a fundamental example of optimizing investment strategies and is a common topic in technical interviews.

Happy coding and keep pushing your limits! 😊
