# Additional Notes 📝

- **Binomial Coefficients 📐:**  
  This solution leverages the mathematical formula for binomial coefficients to calculate each element in the row efficiently.

- **Row Construction 🔺:**  
  Each row starts with `1`, and subsequent values are calculated based on the previous value in the row.

- **Efficiency ⏱️:**  
  The algorithm generates Pascal's Triangle in O(numRows²) time, which is efficient for this problem size.

- **Applications 💡:**  
  Pascal's Triangle is useful in combinatorics, probability, and algebra.

Happy coding and keep exploring new problems! 😊
