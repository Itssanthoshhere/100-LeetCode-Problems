# Additional Notes 📝

- **In-Place Operation:**  
  The algorithm moves zeros to the end without using extra space, ensuring an O(1) space complexity. 🚀

- **Two-Pointer Technique:**  
  The solution uses a pointer (`nonZeroIndex`) to track the position where the next non-zero element should be placed. 🔢

- **Time Complexity:**  
  The array is traversed only once, resulting in an efficient O(n) time complexity. ⏱️

- **Maintaining Order:**  
  By swapping only when a non-zero is encountered, the relative order of the non-zero elements is preserved. ✅

This problem is an excellent exercise in array manipulation and efficient in-place algorithms. Happy coding! 😊
