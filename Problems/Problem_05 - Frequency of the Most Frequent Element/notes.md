# Additional Notes 📝

- **Sorting is Key 🔑:**  
  Sorting the array ensures that when you use the sliding window, elements within the window are consecutive. This makes it easier to calculate the number of operations required.

- **Sliding Window Technique 💡:**  
  The window expands as long as the cost to equalize the window elements is within `k`.  
  If the cost exceeds `k`, the window is shrunk from the left.

- **Optimization:**  
  Although this approach is efficient for the given constraints, always consider edge cases such as arrays with identical elements or when `k` is very small.

- **Time Complexity:**  
  Sorting takes O(n log n), and the sliding window approach is O(n), making the solution efficient for moderate-sized inputs.
