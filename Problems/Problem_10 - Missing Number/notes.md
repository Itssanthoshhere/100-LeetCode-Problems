# Additional Notes 📝

- **XOR Magic 🔮:**  
  The solution leverages the XOR operation to cancel out matching indices and values.  
  - Each index and number in the range [0, n] appears once except the missing number.
  - XORing them together yields the missing number.

- **Time Complexity ⏱️:**  
  The algorithm runs in O(n) time, making it efficient for large input sizes.

- **Space Efficiency 🚀:**  
  The solution uses constant extra space (O(1)), as it modifies nothing in the input array.

This problem is a great example of using bitwise operations to solve problems efficiently. Happy coding! 😊
