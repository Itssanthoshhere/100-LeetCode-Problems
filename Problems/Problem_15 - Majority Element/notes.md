# Additional Notes 📝

- **Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm 🗳️:**  
  This solution uses the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm, a clever approach that finds the majority element in O(n) time with O(1) space.

- **How It Works 🔍:**  
  The algorithm maintains a candidate and a count. It increases the count for the same element and decreases it for different ones. When the count drops to 0, a new candidate is chosen.

- **Efficiency 🚀:**  
  - **Time Complexity:** O(n)  
  - **Space Complexity:** O(1)

- **Why It Matters 💡:**  
  Understanding this algorithm is essential for optimizing solutions in technical interviews and real-world scenarios where performance is critical.

Happy coding and keep challenging yourself! 😊
