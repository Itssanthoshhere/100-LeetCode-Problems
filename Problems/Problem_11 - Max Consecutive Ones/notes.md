# Additional Notes 📝

- **Simple Traversal:**  
  The algorithm iterates through the array once, keeping track of consecutive 1's. ⏱️

- **Count Resetting:**  
  Whenever a 0 is encountered, the counter resets to 0, ensuring only consecutive 1's are counted. 🔄

- **Efficiency:**  
  This solution operates in O(n) time with O(1) extra space—ideal for large arrays. 🚀

- **Use Cases:**  
  A great exercise for understanding array traversal and condition-based counting.

Happy coding! 😊
