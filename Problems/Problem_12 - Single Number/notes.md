# Additional Notes 📝

- **XOR Operation Magic 🔮:**  
  Using XOR (^) is key because XORing a number with itself cancels out to 0.  
  Only the single number remains after XORing all elements together.

- **Time Complexity ⏱️:**  
  The solution runs in O(n) time, making it optimal for large inputs.

- **Space Efficiency 🚀:**  
  It uses constant extra space (O(1)), since no additional data structures are needed.

This problem is a perfect example of how bit manipulation can lead to clean and efficient solutions. Happy coding! 😊
