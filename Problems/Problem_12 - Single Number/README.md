# Problem 12 - Single Number

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Platform:** LeetCode

## Problem Statement

Given a non-empty array of integers "nums", every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.  
You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

## Examples

**Example 1:**  
```
Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**  
```
Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```

**Example 3:**  
```
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
```
