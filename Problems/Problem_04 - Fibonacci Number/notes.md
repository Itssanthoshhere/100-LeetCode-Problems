# Additional Notes

- **Recursive Approach:**  
  The solution provided uses recursion. For larger values of "n", this method may lead to performance issues due to redundant calculations.
  
- **Optimization Tip:**  
  Consider using memoization or an iterative approach to improve efficiency for larger inputs.
  
- **Key Takeaway:**  
  This problem is a great way to understand the fundamentals of recursion and the importance of optimizing recursive algorithms.
