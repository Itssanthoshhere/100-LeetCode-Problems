# Additional Notes

- **Skipping Non-Alphanumeric Characters:** The solution uses `isalnum` to skip any characters that are not letters or numbers.
- **Case-Insensitive Comparison:** Characters are converted to lowercase using `tolower` to ensure the comparison is case-insensitive.
- **Two-Pointer Approach:** This technique efficiently checks for palindromes by comparing characters from the beginning and end of the string simultaneously.
