# Additional Notes 📝

- **Modulo Operation 🔢:**  
  We use `k = k % n` to handle cases where `k` is greater than the array size.

- **Reversal Technique 🔄:**  
  The approach involves:
  1. Reversing the entire array.
  2. Reversing the first `k` elements.
  3. Reversing the remaining `n-k` elements.
  
  This method efficiently rotates the array in-place without extra space.

- **Time Complexity ⏱️:**  
  The solution runs in O(n) time, which is optimal for this problem.

- **In-Place Operation 🚀:**  
  Since all operations are done in-place, the space complexity is O(1).

This problem is a great example of how creative use of array reversal can lead to efficient solutions. Happy coding! 😊
